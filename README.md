# My personal dot file repository
This is rebooted with a clean slate. Let's see where we end up.

This setup is geared towards usage in macOS and Ubuntu. macOS terminal client of choice is [iTerm 2](https://iterm2.com). Ubuntu on Windows 10 runs through [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10), with [Microsoft Terminal](https://github.com/Microsoft/Terminal).

At the moment, I'm trying out the theme [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com).
## Dependencies
* [Nord theme for iTerm 2](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-iterm2)

## Inspirations
DJ Adams, all the way! [His dotfiles](https://github.com/qmacro/dotfiles).

### *bashrc.d*
I noticed DJ had split his bashrc into smaller scripts, and dynamically load them from bashrc.d. That is a great way to prevent bashrc to grow infinitely. I'm on board with it. ğŸ˜ƒ

### Old setup based on
* Nathaniel Landaus blogpost ["My Mac OSX bash profile"](https://natelandau.com/my-mac-osx-bash_profile/).
* Corey Schafers YouTube video ["How I Setup a New Development Machine - Using Scripts to Automate Installs and Save Time"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIdiWut8eD8)
* Mathias Bynens dotfiles([Github](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles))
* Sindre SÃ¸rhus Quicklook plugins ([Github](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-look-plugins))
