# My personal dot file repository
This is rebooted with a clean slate. Let's see where we end up.

## Inspirations
DJ Adams, all the way! [His dotfiles](https://github.com/qmacro/dotfiles).

### *bashrc.d* 
I noticed DJ had split his bashrc into smaller scripts, and dynamically load them from bashrc.d. That is a great way to prevent bashrc to grow infinitely. I'm on board with it. ğŸ˜ƒ

### Old setup based on
* Nathaniel Landaus blogpost ["My Mac OSX bash profile"](https://natelandau.com/my-mac-osx-bash_profile/). 
* Corey Schafers YouTube video ["How I Setup a New Development Machine - Using Scripts to Automate Installs and Save Time"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIdiWut8eD8)
* Mathias Bynens dotfiles([Github](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles))
* Sindre SÃ¸rhus Quicklook plugins ([Github](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-look-plugins))
